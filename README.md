# CSC455 Final Project
Spring 2020 Semester
CSC 455 - Database Design and Implementation 

## Project Description 
During CSC 455, we were tasked with creating and implementing a database from scratch. Alex, having expeirence in the food service industry, came up with the idea to make a restaurant POS system. This database is setup for the use of cooks and servers, to create, complete, and return a customers order, while holding a mutable count of the current on hand stock of ingredients and past/present orders.

## Setup and Usage  

After connecting to the UNCW network:
```bash
javac JavaFrontend/src/JDBC.java
java JavaFrontend/src/JDBC.java
```
